# Pi Compatibility

SoL-Pi is developed and tested against `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` 0.85.1 and remains compatible with the originally supported 0.84.2 release. This fork pins development to Pi 0.87.1 and runs the complete suite on both 0.87.1 and 0.85.1 on Windows (310 passed, 1 POSIX-only test skipped on each), because Pi 0.86/0.87 changed the extension surface: `ToolResultMessage.details` became JSON-compatible, strict-prefer JSON-schema sampling became the default for built-in tools, `context` handlers no longer see system messages, and runs requested from `agent_settled` are deferred until every settled handler finishes. The current 26 test files, type checking, package inspection, public API checks, and offline extension startup passed on all three releases. Previous checks covered the public API surface of Pi 0.81.1, the base used by the original Pi fork; they are not a current full-suite compatibility guarantee. The runtime range is deliberately expressed as a peer dependency because Pi owns installation and upgrade of its packages; it is not a guarantee for every Pi version.

SoL-Pi imports only public package exports:

- `createEditToolDefinition`
- `createWriteToolDefinition`
- `createBashToolDefinition`
- extension types and `ExtensionAPI.registerTool`
- `context`, `before_provider_request`, `tool_result`, `turn_end`, `agent_settled`, and `session_before_tree` extension events
- native compaction events, `ExtensionContext.getContextUsage()`, and `ExtensionContext.compact()`
- `ExtensionContext.model` and `ExtensionContext.modelRegistry`
- the public session-manager methods exposed through `ExtensionContext`

## Action Fusion

The built-in edit/write definitions capture their working directory, so SoL-Pi caches one definition per `ctx.cwd`. Its own per-file queue surrounds the built-in mutation and follow-up command. It does not nest Pi's built-in mutation queue.

Action Fusion decodes `file://` targets with Node's `fileURLToPath()` before resolving the queue and hash-check path. This keeps file URLs, including percent-encoded filenames and Pi's optional `@` prefix, aligned with the file handled by the built-in mutation tool.

On Windows it applies the same drive-path conversion Pi's own resolver applies, so Git Bash, MSYS, Cygwin, and WSL targets such as `/c/src/app.ts` and home-relative `~\` paths resolve to the file the built-in mutation tool wrote. On other platforms those inputs keep their POSIX meaning.

The queue covers only fused operations registered by this SoL-Pi instance. External processes, direct built-in-tool calls outside the replacement, and unrelated extensions are not globally locked. SoL-Pi hashes the target immediately before launching `then_run` and skips the command if it observes an intervening content change.

## ObservationPack

ObservationPack changes only the messages projected through the public `context` event. Stored session history remains intact. Original bytes and the JSONL ledger live under the session-derived SoL-Pi directory.

## Evidence-Preserving Reducer

The reducer handles public `tool_result` events and resolves the configured reducer provider/model through Pi's model registry before calling `ExtensionContext.modelRegistry.complete()`. The `getApiKeyAndHeaders()` + `@earendil-works/pi-ai/compat` branch, which existed only for the unpublished Pi 0.81.1 fork, is removed in this fork; both supported release lines expose `complete()`. An unauthenticated or unresolvable reducer model now fails before a request is built, through `modelRegistry.hasConfiguredAuth()` when the build provides it. The reducer preserves the original result whenever the configured reducer model is unavailable or eligibility, model-call, schema, source-hash, exact-quote, size, or concurrency checks fail.

Pi's `powershell` tool is treated as a shell result alongside `bash`, and the accepted tool names come from `evidencePreservingReducerOptions.tools`. Command eligibility uses per-ecosystem presets instead of one hardcoded regex, so `dotnet test`, `msbuild`, `gradlew test`, `npx vitest`, and `npm run test` are reduced too. Secret-looking values are redacted before the log is sent, and quotes are verified against that redacted projection; the archived original keeps the exact bytes for local readback.

All persistent paths use `SessionManager.getSessionDir()` and `getSessionId()`, which are present in both the fork and Pi 0.85.1. SoL-Pi creates no configurable storage-path surface. Reducer archives are pruned after `retentionDays`; ObservationPack archives are not. Archive and observation objects reject symlinks and non-regular files through an explicit `lstat` check, because `O_NOFOLLOW` is ignored on Windows.

The unpublished shared artifact layout is not read or migrated. Each session starts from its own `<sessionDir>/sol-pi/<sessionId>/` directory.

## Online Context Compact

Online Context Compact uses ordinary public `context` and `before_provider_request` handlers instead of fork-only post-transform observer methods. Public handlers run in extension load order, so the SoL-Pi entrypoint registers Online Context Compact after its other context transformers. A third-party transformer loaded later is outside the context-growth observation used by its estimate.

Pi does not expose its active retained-tail compaction setting through the public extension context. The standalone extension therefore uses the Pi 0.85.1 default of 20,000 tokens for its economic estimate. Its programmatic factory accepts an explicit matching value for a non-default Pi setting.

Pi 0.85.1's `ExtensionContext.compact()` aborts the active agent before it summarizes, and `agent_settled` fires only once a whole run has drained every turn, retry, auto-compaction, and queued continuation. A plan boundary that selects compaction therefore saves its plan and progress state, calls `ExtensionContext.abort()` to stop the run, and runs compaction from the `agent_settled` that stop produces. The handler awaits the compaction's own `onComplete`/`onError` callbacks. On success, the extension sends a hidden reminder through public `ExtensionAPI.sendMessage()` with `triggerTurn: true`, so Pi starts a new turn against the compacted context and rebuilds the plan even when the native summary omits that instruction.

A settlement barrier keeps the original `agent_settled` dispatch open until the triggered continuation settles. Print- and JSON-mode processes therefore complete the compact-and-continue sequence within the same Pi invocation; an outer driver does not need to resume the session or send `Continue working`. This continuation is armed only by a successful boundary compaction. Cancelling or exiting does not schedule one. A Pi build that never emits `agent_settled` starts no boundary compaction.

Pi 0.85.1 does not return a promise from `ExtensionAPI.sendMessage()`. The barrier is therefore verified for standalone SoL-Pi and depends on Pi starting the requested turn synchronously. A later-loaded third-party extension that performs long asynchronous work in its own `agent_settled` handler is outside this guarantee and needs an integration test with that extension set.

Pi reports the session as idle while an extension-requested manual compaction is running. SoL-Pi cancels `session_before_tree` during that interval to prevent tree navigation from moving the active leaf underneath the compaction. Navigation works normally after the compaction callback settles.

Online Context Compact reads `ExtensionContext.getContextUsage()` for both the context window and the provider-counted context size. When Pi reports no size — as it does between a compaction and the next answered request — the boundary falls back to its own estimate.

The standalone entry passes `cacheWriteReadRatio` from `sol-pi.json` directly into Online Context Compact's economic check. It does not inspect model price metadata. Changing models during a session does not change the ratio; users who want a different decision policy update the configuration and start a new session.

## Interactive TUI

The lightning savings treatment uses Pi 0.85.1's public `renderCall`,
`renderResult`, `ctx.ui.notify()`, and keyed `ctx.ui.setStatus()` APIs. It checks
`ctx.mode === "tui"` rather than `ctx.hasUI`, because RPC mode also reports UI
support. The renderer therefore changes only the interactive terminal display;
it does not change session messages, provider requests, tool results, JSON
events, print output, or RPC UI requests.

## Test doubles

The test suite drives every extension through the same public `ExtensionAPI` and `ExtensionContext` surface Pi provides, over a real public `SessionManager`, without calling a remote model provider. That keeps the suite zero-spend and independent of the deleted Pi monorepo test harness. Suites that need a genuine session tree — branch order, compaction entries, custom entries, resume — use `SessionManager.inMemory()` or `SessionManager.create()` rather than reimplementing them.

`tests/pi-package-integration.test.ts` loads the actual TypeScript entrypoint through Pi's `DefaultResourceLoader`, reads a trusted all-enabled project configuration, and executes a fused write/command and a plan update in a real `AgentSession`. `tests/online-context-compact-agent-session.test.ts` verifies one and two consecutive native compactions and waits for automatic continuation before the original prompt returns. These integration tests use Pi's deterministic faux provider; they verify runtime compatibility, not live provider authentication or token savings.

The 0.84.2 backward-compatibility run used an isolated copy of the current source and tests, separate dependencies, and an empty Pi agent directory. Only the copy's four Pi development dependency versions, lockfile, and installation-guide version mentions changed. No source or test changes were needed. The run included all four mechanisms and the native compaction/continuation integration tests; it did not repeat live-provider benchmarks on 0.84.2.
